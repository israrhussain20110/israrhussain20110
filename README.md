# Israr Hussain
AI Engineer focused on **applied LLM systems** and **data-driven business analytics**.

I build production-oriented AI solutions where correctness, clarity, and measurable impact matter more than demos or buzzwords.

## What I Build

### AI Chatbot Systems
End-to-end chatbot implementations designed for real-world usage.

- LLM-powered conversational systems
- Structured prompts with explicit constraints and guardrails
- API-first backend architecture
- Emphasis on latency, reliability, and predictable behavior

Use cases:
- Domain-specific question answering
- Internal knowledge systems
- Operational and customer support automation

---

### Pharmaceutical Analytics & KPI Systems
Complete analytics pipelines that transform raw pharmaceutical data into **decision-ready KPIs**.

- Data cleaning, validation, and transformation
- KPI definition aligned with business and operational needs
- Analytical outputs focused on interpretability
- Accuracy prioritized over visualization noise

Typical KPI areas:
- Sales and demand trends
- Product and portfolio performance
- Operational efficiency metrics
- Market-level insights

## Flagship Projects

### AI Chatbot Implementation
A production-ready chatbot system built for domain-specific applications.

- Clean separation of concerns
- Controlled and testable prompt behavior
- Scalable backend structure

See the repository for architecture, data flow, and implementation details.

---

### Pharmaceutical KPI Analysis System
An end-to-end pharmaceutical analytics workflow focused on actionable KPIs.

- Raw data to final metrics pipeline
- Transparent assumptions and calculations
- Clear analytical outputs for decision-making

Designed for real operational insight, not academic exercises.

---

## How I Approach Engineering
- Systems before features
- Explicit assumptions and trade-offs
- Minimal tools, maximum clarity
- If it can’t be explained clearly, it isn’t finished
